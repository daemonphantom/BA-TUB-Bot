## Rolling Volatility (One Year)

One year rolling volatility (calculated by taking the standard deviation of daily returns, annualized) was 93% correlated between Dec 31, 2007 and June 28, 2019, when comparing the two indexes. Given the large exposure the Nasdaq-100 has towards Technology, the ability for the Nasdaq-100 to closely track the volatility of the S&P 500 is rather impressive.

## Current Industry Weights

We can see important differences between the Nasdaq-100 and the S&P 500 as of June 28, 2019. As mentioned previously, the largest allocations in the Nasdaq-100 are geared towards Technology (55%), Consumer Services (25%), and Health Care (8%). The large allocations to both Technology and Consumer Services have helped propel the Nasdaq-100 Index to a new all-time high as of the close on May 3, 2019.

Despite the sharp drop in the market from October to December 2018, the Nasdaq-100 still outperformed S&P 500 by 4% in 2018 and by 3% in the first half of 2019 from a total return standpoint.

## Conclusion

The Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500 are two of the most popular equity indexes in the US. We provided performance and volatility analysis over the last 11 and a half years. The Nasdaq-100 is heavily allocated towards top performing industries such as Technology, Consumer Services, and Health Care. The growth of companies in these industries has continued to be strong. Given the way technology is influencing the world and making companies more efficient, this trend is more than likely to continue going forward.
